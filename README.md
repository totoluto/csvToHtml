# CSV to Html

---------------
This is a `java` project I wrote to make a table for a website based on an `excel` table.
## Setup
You'll need a `.CSV` file for the program to work. <br>
You don't know how to get one? Here is a gif:

If you have a CSV file, then just import it into the project folder and rename it to `data.csv` or change the path in `main.java:17` to your file name. 

Then just run the project, and it will write the `html` code into `output.txt`.
Just copy the code from `output.txt` and insert it to your web application.
